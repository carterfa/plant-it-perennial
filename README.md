### Plan-It-Perennial - Team Red
​
### Project Goal

The user will visit the website and input their location.  The app will then check the climate in that area and also what the current season is.  After retrieving the weather data, the app wil then check the plant database and determine which plants would do well in the user's location at that season.  The user can also check if a particular plant would do well in their area.  The app will then display all these results to the user on the page.
